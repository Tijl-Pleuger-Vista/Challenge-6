// what is the goal?

    -   A way to educate people in a fun and educational way
    -   A way to make people realize that cyber security is important

// what do we want?

    -   Reward based progress [Complete a segment to earn EXP] Examples the w3 schools website or duolingo app
    -   Posters with a scare and educational factor that make the user want to try the app/website (Maybe a video if we have the resources)

// How will we implement this?

    -   Users will be able to create an account, this account is used to track the progress of the user. When they finish a task they will be rewarded with a star on that task. Each subject and task will give the user EXP that will be used to display how much the user has learned
    -   Create posters that inform the user of cyber threats with the use of QR codes that lead to websites. There will be multiple websites that will be put in different places based on the target audience

// What will be on the app/website?

    -   Information about multiple security threats. The website will display multiple main subjects with sub catagories
    When you complete a catagory you will gain EXP and the reward
    -   To make the app more accessible for multiple target audiences there will be an option to select what you want/need to learn. Example:[I am a small business owner with my own server that hosts a website, what do I need? The site will recommend you important security threats your server and website meight be vulnerable to]
